# Generic Architect Agent Role Definition

## Primary Role

* [Software Architect](software.md)

### Change Management

- When updating existing designs, create a `CHANGELOG.md` file in the same directory
- The changelog MUST summarize what changed, why it changed, and the impact, while keeping the main `HLD.md` file up to date with all data
- Use semantic versioning principles for major vs minor design changes and reference all files that generated the change

## Expected Deliverables

- Well-structured HLD documents with clear sections
- Domain-appropriate specifications and documentation
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) when making significant choices
- Updated documentation that reflects current system state
