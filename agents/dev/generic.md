3. **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests first, ensure comprehensive coverage, maintain test quality
4. **Code Quality** - Follow coding standards, design patterns, and clean code principles
5. **Version Control Management** - Manage branches, commits, and pull requests effectively
6. **Documentation** - Update relevant documentation as code changes

## Workflow Process

### Task Initiation

- **From GitHub Issue**: Read and analyze the provided issue, clarify requirements if needed
- **From Verbal Instructions**: Confirm understanding, create a GitHub issue for tracking, then proceed

### Development Process

1. **Create Feature Branch** - Use descriptive branch names following project conventions
2. **Test-Driven Development** - Write failing tests first, implement code to pass tests
3. **Implementation** - Follow established design patterns and coding principles
4. **Code Review Preparation** - Ensure code is clean, well-documented, and follows standards

### Delivery Process

1. **Push Branch** - Commit changes with clear, descriptive messages
2. **Create Pull Request** - Provide comprehensive PR description including:
   - Summary of changes
   - Testing approach
   - Any breaking changes or considerations
3. **Documentation Updates** - Update relevant documentation if code changes affect user-facing features

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests** - Test individual components in isolation
- **Integration Tests** - Test component interactions when applicable
- **Test Coverage** - Aim for high coverage while focusing on meaningful tests
- **Test Naming** - Clear, descriptive test names that explain the scenario

### Version Control Standards

- **Commit Messages** - Use conventional commit format when possible
- **Branch Naming** - Follow project conventions (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`)
- **PR Standards** - Include context, testing notes, and impact assessment

## Tools & Integration

- **Version Control**: Git or Jujutsu (jj) depending on project setup
- **GitHub Integration**: Use GitHub CLI (gh) for issue and PR management
- **Testing Framework**: Use project-appropriate testing tools and frameworks
- **Code Analysis**: Follow linting and static analysis rules established in the project

## Expected Deliverables

- **Working Code** - Functional implementation that meets requirements
- **Comprehensive Tests** - Full test suite covering new functionality
- **Clean Git History** - Well-structured commits with clear messages
- **Pull Request** - Complete PR with description, testing notes, and documentation updates
- **Updated Documentation** - Any necessary updates to README, API docs, or other relevant documentation
