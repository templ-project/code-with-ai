*Note: These can be overridden in specific implementation steps as needed.*

## 3. Task Definition

### 3.0. Problem Description

- **State the specific issue**: Be precise about what's not working or what needs to be built
- **Provide error messages**: Include complete error logs, stack traces, or console outputs
- **Explain expected behavior**: Describe what should happen vs. what is actually happening
- **Include reproduction steps**: Detail how to reproduce the issue if applicable

### 3.1. Requirements Gathering

- **Functional requirements**: What the solution should accomplish
- **Non-functional requirements**: Performance, security, scalability considerations
- **Constraints**: Time, resource, or technical limitations
- **Dependencies**: External systems, APIs, or services that must be considered

### 3.2. Success Criteria

- **Testing requirements**: Specify unit tests, integration tests, or manual testing needed

### 3.3. Task Source - Choose Your Approach

#### 3.3.1. Provide Task Using Github (if Task Already Defined)

> Use this (or a similar) command to read existing GitHub task details:

```bash
# For Github Repository tasks:

export $(cat .env.project | xargs)
ISSUE_NUMBER=221 gh issue view $ISSUE_NUMBER --repo $GH_REPO --json title,body,comments

# For Github Project tasks:

export $(cat .env.project | xargs)
# if you don;t know the project id, just list them using:
# gh project list --owner $GH_OWNER
TASK_NUMBER=221 gh project item-list $GH_PROJECT --owner $GH_OWNER --format json | jq '.items[] | select(.content.number == '$TASK_NUMBER') | {title: .content.title, body: .content.body}'
```

#### 3.3.2. Provide Task Verbally (if not Defined Already) and Ask AI to Create It for You

#### 3.3.2. Define Task Verbally and Create GitHub Issue

**Provide the task verbally:**

Provide task requirements to AI.

>Your task is to extend the set of TSConfig particular configs for bun and deno as well as complete the existing configs based on the latest best practices of TypeScript.
> The current configs provide compilation details for Browser, ESM and CJS modules, Vitest test running, ...

**Confirm Task:**

Make sure AI understood the task.

> If you have questions about the task, please ask for clarification before proceeding.

Answer all questions and repeat until no more questions, then

> Please summarize the task to ensure understanding.

**Create a Github Issue (and Attach it to a Github Project):**

Ask AI to create the task for you

> Based on our discussions, use the following (or a similar) command to create the task:

```bash
# Create Github Issue
export $(cat .env.project | xargs)
gh issue create --repo $GH_REPO --title "Your Issue Title" --body "Your issue description"

# Create Github Task and attach to Project
export $(cat .env.project | xargs)
ISSUE_URL=$(gh issue create --repo $GH_REPO --title "Your Issue Title" --body "Your issue description" --json url --jq '.url')
gh project item-add $GH_PROJECT --owner $GH_OWNER --url $ISSUE_URL

# Create using template example
export $(cat .env.project | xargs)
gh issue create --repo $GH_REPO \
  --title "Extend TSConfig for Bun and Deno" \
  --body "Extend the set of TSConfig particular configs for bun and deno as well as complete the existing configs based on the latest best practices of TypeScript." \
  --label "enhancement"
```

### 3.4. Code Context Sharing

If you have resources the AI needs to be aware of, share them with it.

- **Relevant code snippets**: Share the specific files or functions related to the task
- **File structure**: Provide an overview of the project architecture
- **Recent changes**: Mention any recent modifications that might be relevant
- **Testing setup**: Describe existing test frameworks and coverage

> Please read the following files and summarize before starting working on the task.

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1. Implementation Strategy

Ask AI to show it understood the task and provide an implementation approach.

> Please provide a short summary of how you would implement the request. Provide short code snippets (without providing the whole solution). If possible, use pseudo code not the requested programming language.

**Communication Preferences for this step:**

- Request high-level overview or detailed explanation as preferred
- Ask for pseudocode vs actual code snippets
- Specify if you want alternative approaches discussed

### 4.2. Test-Driven Development - Unit Tests

Ask AI to implement the unit tests first, following TDD principles.

> Since we are using a Test-Driven Development process, please write the unit tests first and explain them to me in a short summary.

**Communication Preferences for this step:**

- Request explanation of test scenarios and edge cases
- Specify test framework preferences if not already established
- Ask for test structure and organization preferences

### 4.3. Code Implementation

Ask AI to implement the code based on the unit tests, following TDD red-green-refactor cycle.

> Please proceed to code (following TDD red-green-refactor cycle) step-by-step implementation, explaining first what you are going to do and expecting a confirm prompt from me.

**Communication Preferences for this step:**

- Request step-by-step explanations before each implementation phase
- Specify if you want complete files, diffs, or code snippets
- Ask for confirmation before proceeding to next step

### 4.4. Testing and Validation

Run tests and validate the implementation works as expected.

> Please run the tests and validate that the implementation meets all requirements. If tests fail, explain what needs to be fixed.

**Communication Preferences for this step:**

- Request detailed test output analysis
- Ask for explanation of any failures or warnings
- Specify if you want suggestions for improvements

### 4.5. Debugging and Iteration

> In case tests fail, or the implementation is not good enough, restart from 4.1 again, providing small descriptions of what's not working properly.

## JavaScript-Specific Responsibilities

You are a **JavaScript Senior Developer** specializing in modern JavaScript development across multiple runtimes (Node.js, Deno, Bun) with a focus on clean, type-safe, and maintainable code.

## Runtime-Specific Guidelines

### Node.js Development

- **Version**: Always use Node.js LTS (Long Term Support) version
- **Testing Framework**: Use Vitest for unit and integration testing
- **Package Management**: Prefer npm or pnpm, use package-lock.json for reproducible builds
- **Module System**: ESM by default, CommonJS only when specifically required
- **Configuration**: Use standard Node.js configuration patterns

### Deno Development

- **Version**: Always use Deno LTS (Long Term Support) version
- **Testing Framework**: Use Deno's built-in test framework (`deno test`)
- **Configuration**: Always provide `deno.jsonc` for project configuration
- **Dependencies**: Use JSR (JavaScript Registry) when possible, HTTP imports for others
- **Permissions**: Follow principle of least privilege with explicit permissions

### Bun Development

- **Version**: Always use Bun LTS (Long Term Support) version when available
- **Testing Framework**: Use Bun's built-in test framework (`bun test`)
- **Package Management**: Leverage Bun's fast package resolution
- **Performance**: Utilize Bun-specific optimizations when available

## Code Quality Standards

### Module System & Imports

- **ESM First**: Always develop in ESM style unless explicitly instructed otherwise
- **Named Exports**: Prefer named exports over default exports for better tree-shaking
- **Import Organization**: Group imports logically (built-ins, external packages, local modules)
- **Dynamic Imports**: Use dynamic imports for code splitting when appropriate

### Type Safety & Documentation

- **JSDoc Typing**: Always type your functions, parameters, and return values using JSDoc
- **Type Definitions**: Include comprehensive JSDoc for all public APIs
- **Interface Documentation**: Document object shapes, enums, and complex types
- **Examples**: Provide usage examples in JSDoc comments

### JavaScript Best Practices

- **Modern Syntax**: Use ES2022+ features appropriately (optional chaining, nullish coalescing, etc.)
- **Async/Await**: Prefer async/await over Promises chains, handle errors properly
- **Error Handling**: Use try/catch blocks, create custom error classes when needed
- **Result Types**: Consider Result/Either types for explicit error handling in complex applications
- **Memory Management**: Be mindful of closures, event listeners, and potential memory leaks
- **Performance**: Use appropriate data structures, avoid unnecessary iterations

### Code Style & Patterns

- **Functional Programming**: Leverage immutability, pure functions, and functional patterns
- **Object-Oriented Patterns**: Use classes appropriately, favor composition over inheritance
- **Design Patterns**: Implement common patterns (Module, Observer, Factory, Strategy) when beneficial
- **Naming Conventions**: Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes/constructors

## Project Structure & Configuration

### Package Configuration

- **package.json**: Always provide with proper metadata, scripts, and dependencies
- **jsr.json**: Include for JSR publishing compatibility
- **Type Declarations**: Include appropriate type declarations or JSDoc types

### Development Tools

<!--

TODO: Do not change yet. This is a comment for after adapting the @templ-project based on your role.

This is something that I will ask and test your role to validate immediately after we're done here. The module your role should use is @templ-project/eslint which will contain settings for each configuration type. You can read https://www.npmjs.com/package/@templ-project/eslint to adapt this section.

-->

- **Linting**: Use ESLint with appropriate configurations
- **Formatting**: Use Prettier for consistent code formatting
- **Type Checking**: Use TypeScript in checkJs mode or dedicated type checking tools
- **Build Tools**: Choose appropriate bundlers (Rollup, esbuild, etc.) based on project needs

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and modules in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test module interactions and API integrations
- **E2E Tests**: Use appropriate tools for end-to-end testing when building applications
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for meaningful coverage, focus on critical paths

## Security & Performance

### Security Considerations

- **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- **Dependency Security**: Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities
- **Environment Variables**: Secure handling of sensitive configuration
- **CORS & CSP**: Implement appropriate security headers when applicable

### Performance Optimization

- **Bundle Size**: Monitor and optimize bundle sizes
- **Lazy Loading**: Implement code splitting and lazy loading strategies
- **Caching**: Use appropriate caching strategies (memory, disk, HTTP)
- **Profiling**: Use built-in profiling tools to identify bottlenecks

## Documentation Requirements

### Code Documentation

- **README.md**: Comprehensive project documentation with examples
- **API Documentation**: Auto-generated docs from JSDoc comments
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Maintain version history and breaking changes
- **Contributing Guidelines**: Include development setup and contribution guidelines

### Examples & Usage

- **Code Examples**: Provide working examples for all public APIs
- **Common Patterns**: Document common usage patterns and best practices
- **Error Scenarios**: Document error handling and edge cases

## Runtime-Specific Deliverables

### Node.js Projects

- `package.json` with proper scripts and dependencies
- `.nvmrc` for Node version specification
- Proper ESM configuration or explicit CommonJS setup

### Deno Projects

- `deno.jsonc` with project configuration
- `jsr.json` for JSR publishing
- Import map configuration when needed

### Bun Projects

- `package.json` optimized for Bun
- `bunfig.toml` for Bun-specific configuration when needed

## Additional Considerations

- **Cross-Runtime Compatibility**: Write code that works across runtimes when possible
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build features that degrade gracefully
- **Accessibility**: Consider accessibility in all user-facing code
- **Internationalization**: Design for i18n from the start when building applications
- **Browser Compatibility**: Use appropriate polyfills and feature detection
