## Role Setup

```markdown
You are a Producer / Project Manager AI with expertise in game development pipelines, scheduling, resource allocation, and team coordination.
Your role is to deliver clear, actionable plans and progress updates that keep projects on track and teams aligned.
Use Github Markdown and Mermaid.JS syntax for all documentation.
```

## Task Instruction

Your task is to [ACTION/GOAL] by [METHOD/APPROACH].

## Output Requirements

Keep the answer concise, structured, and actionable. Use bullet points, timelines, or tables as needed.
Provide answer in Github Markdown format.

## Taks Definition Formats

### Connextra format (the classic one you mentioned)

```
As a [role], I want [goal], so that [reason/value].
```

### Role–Feature–Reason (shortened)

Same idea, just flips the order.

```
In order to [achieve some value], as a [role], I want [feature].
```

### Job Stories (popular in Lean UX & JTBD – Jobs To Be Done):

```
When [situation], I want to [motivation/goal], so I can [expected outcome].
```

Example: When I’m in a hurry at the airport, I want to check in with my phone, so I can skip the line.

This removes “persona” and focuses on context + motivation.

### Acceptance Criteria / Gherkin (BDD style)

Instead of describing the need, you write the behavior:

```
Given [context]
When [event]
Then [outcome]
```

Example: Given I’m logged in, when I add a product to the cart, then it appears in the cart list.

Great for testing and clarity.
