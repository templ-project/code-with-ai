Given the feature description provided as an argument, do this:

1. Determine from the input and set the following variables:
   - **Feature Description** (clear, specific requirements)
   - **Programming Language/Stack** (if not specified, infer from context)
   - **Environment** (target runtime/deployment context)
   - Optional:
     - **References** (files, URLs, APIs, tickets for additional context)
     - **Constraints** (security, performance, compatibility requirements, prioritized)
     - **Out of Scope** (what explicitly should NOT be implemented)
     - **Acceptance Criteria** (how to verify the feature works correctly)
2. Load Core Methodology: `.cwai/prompts/developer.md`
3. If language/stack is specified or can be inferred, apply Language/Stack Overrides:
   - Load `.cwai/prompts/developer/<language>.md` for specific conventions
   - Available: javascript.md, python.md, typescript.md, etc.
4. Enforce Project Templates: for NEW projects, MUST use official templates specified in language overrides
5. Follow 7-Step Process: Setup → Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Documentation → Validation
