## Execution Flow (main)

1. Parse inputs (business brief, drivers, requirements, current state)
   ‚Üí If missing: ERROR "Insufficient inputs for HLD"
2. Summarize Context & Drivers
   ‚Üí Validate objectives are SMART; else WARN and mark [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
3. Capture Assumptions, Constraints, Dependencies
4. Document Current State (logical, physical, interfaces)
   ‚Üí If unknown: WARN and mark discovery tasks
5. Propose Target Architecture (logical first, then physical)
   ‚Üí Include interface impacts; avoid vendor lock-in specifics unless required
6. Define NFRs & Service Continuity (RTO/RPO, failure modes, SPOF, symmetry)
7. Asses Security & Compliance (threats, controls, data flows)
8. Estimate Cost Model (CapEx / OpEx) & Support Model
9. Define Risks & Mitigations; Decommissioning; Roadmap
10. Run Review Checklist
    ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "HLD has uncertainties"
    ‚Üí If low-level build details present: ERROR "Remove implementation detail"
11. Cleanup document of unnecessary sections.
12. Return: SUCCESS (HLD ready for governance / planning)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ HLD = **WHAT the solution looks like** and **WHY these choices**, not step-by-step build.
- ‚ùå No low-level config, code, or vendor SKUs (leave for LLD/implementation).
- üß© Separate **logical** (concepts & flows) from **physical** (tech components).
- üß™ Every decision should map to drivers, requirements, or constraints.
- üè∑ Use `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ‚Ä¶]` instead of guessing.
