## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse inputs (business brief, drivers, requirements, current state)
   ‚Üí If missing: ERROR "Insufficient inputs for HLD"
2. If `${FEATURE_FOLDER}/high-level-design.md` exists already,
   ‚Üí if file contains [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] tags, fail and instruct to use `/clarify` prompt; else
   ‚Üí continue formulating based on existing content.
3. Summarize Context & Drivers
   ‚Üí Validate objectives are SMART; else WARN and mark [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
4. Capture Assumptions, Constraints, Dependencies
5. Document Current State (logical, physical, interfaces)
   ‚Üí If unknown: WARN and mark discovery tasks
6. Propose Target Architecture (logical first, then physical)
   ‚Üí Include interface impacts; avoid vendor lock-in specifics unless required
7. Define NFRs & Service Continuity (RTO/RPO, failure modes, SPOF, symmetry)
8. Asses Security & Compliance (threats, controls, data flows)
9. Estimate Cost Model (CapEx / OpEx) & Support Model
10. Define Risks & Mitigations; Decommissioning; Roadmap
11. Run Review Checklist
    ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "HLD has uncertainties"
    ‚Üí If low-level build details present: ERROR "Remove implementation detail"
12. Cleanup document of unnecessary sections.
13. Return: SUCCESS (HLD ready for governance / planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ HLD = **WHAT the solution looks like** and **WHY these choices**, not step-by-step build.
- ‚ùå No low-level config, code, or vendor SKUs (leave for LLD/implementation).
- üß© Separate **logical** (concepts & flows) from **physical** (tech components).
- üìê Use diagrams where possible. Use Mermaid.js
- üß™ Every decision should map to drivers, requirements, or constraints.
- üè∑ Use `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ‚Ä¶]` instead of guessing.
