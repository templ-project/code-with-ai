## 1. High Concept

<!-- One or two sentences capturing the core identity / elevator pitch. -->

## 2. Purpose & Target Audience

- Primary audience
- Player motivation (what emotional loop?)

## 3. Player Fantasy & Pillars

- Pillar 1: <short phrase + one sentence>
- Pillar 2: ...
- Pillar 3: ... (3–5 total)

## 4. Core Loop

<!-- Describe the repeating cycle in 3–6 steps. -->

    A[Start / Idle] --> B[Acquire / Engage]
    B --> C[Decision / Challenge]
    C --> D[Resolution / Reward]
    D --> E[Progress / Feedback]
    E --> B
```

## 5. Session Flow

Short textual walkthrough from launch → first decision → escalation → closure.

## 6. Rules

### 6.1 Setup

### 6.2 Turn / Phase Structure (if applicable)

### 6.3 Player Actions

- Action Name: Preconditions → Outcome → Risk/Reward

### 6.4 Constraints & Limits

## 7. Mechanics

List each core mechanic:

| ------ | ------- | -------------- | ------------ |
|        |         |                |              |

## 9. Progression & Difficulty

- Difficulty ramp principles
- Adaptive elements (if any)

## 10. Win / Loss / Failure Conditions

- Win: ...
- Loss: ...
- Soft fail / recovery: ...

## 11. Reward Systems (If Present)

- Type → Player Value → Frequency → Anti-grind safeguards

- Fairness principles
- Avoided negative patterns

## 14. Edge Cases & Exploits
